# Tubes — reverse engineering notes

Running notes on the original DOS build. Facts here are derived from the
binary and the shipped documentation; no original game data lives in this
repository.

## Original files

| File | Size | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `TUBES.EXE` | 46,037 | Main game, LZEXE v0.91 compressed |
| `TUBES.RES` | 524,020 | Custom asset container ("Absolute Magic Resource File!") |
| `DRIVERS.RES` | 7,452 | Same container format; holds 8086 sound-driver blobs |
| `SETUP.EXE` | 13,406 | Config tool, also LZEXE compressed |
| `SETUP.CFG` | 65 | Hardware selections written by SETUP |
| `TUBES.SAV` | 960 | Saved game (zero-filled when empty) |

## TUBES.EXE — LZEXE v0.91

Signature `LZ91` at offset `0x1C`. Nothing in the file is analyzable until
it is decompressed; run `tools/unpack.sh`.

Packed MZ header:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `e_cparhdr` | 2 (32-byte header) |
| `e_cs:e_ip` | `0A9A:000E` |
| `e_crlc` | 0 (stub rebuilds relocations) |

LZEXE stores the original entry state in the 14 bytes immediately below the
stub entry point, which is why `e_ip` is `0x0E`. At file offset `0xA9C0`:

| Offset | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| +0x00 | `AABA` | original IP |
| +0x02 | `0000` | original CS |
| +0x04 | `2000` | original SP |
| +0x06 | `1A70` | original SS |
| +0x08 | `0A9A` | packed size in paragraphs (43,424 bytes) |
| +0x0A | `0DD1` | size increase in paragraphs |
| +0x0C | `0A15` | decompressor length (2,581 bytes) |

Unpacked result: 99,728-byte image, 2,150 relocations, entry `0000:AABA`,
stack `1A70:2000`. The recovered `SS:SP` and `CS:IP` match the info block
above exactly, which is a good end-to-end correctness check.

### Format details worth recording

Forward LZ77 over an LSB-first bit stream buffered as little-endian words:

- `1` — literal byte
- `00` + 2 length bits — short match, length 2–5, 1-byte distance (−1..−256)
- `01` — long match, 13-bit distance (−1..−8192), 3-bit length

When the 3-bit length field is zero, an extra byte follows: `0` ends the
stream and `1` is a segment-normalization no-op; any other value is
`length + 1`.

Two traps, both of which cost time here:

1. Some online descriptions have the two escape values swapped. The
   authoritative behavior is `0` = end, `1` = segment change.
2. The bit reader must sample the bit *before* decrementing the counter, and
   must not shift on the refill step. Getting this wrong yields 16 bits from
   the first flag word instead of 15 and desynchronizes the stream
   immediately — with symptoms that look like a correct decoder, since the
   first 15 bytes still decode into valid x86.

We use the upstream `unlzexe` rather than a reimplementation.

## Resource containers

Both `.RES` files begin with the ASCII banner `Absolute Magic Resource File!`
followed by `\r\n\x1a` (32 bytes total), then what appears to be a table.

`TUBES.RES` bulk data shows a strongly regular pattern of `FF` followed by
8-byte groups, suggesting a run/literal marker scheme over VGA pixel data.
Unconfirmed.

`DRIVERS.RES` contains real 8086 code — `55 8B EC ... CA 02 00`
(`push bp; mov bp,sp; ... retf 2`), i.e. far-called driver entry points for
the PC speaker / Sound Blaster / Adlib backends. **These are not needed for
the port**; SDL replaces them entirely.

## Game design (from TUBES.DOC)

Falling-atom puzzler in the Columns lineage. Catch atoms from dispenser
tubes with a player-controlled test tube and place them into a beaker;
match 3+ of a colour horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

- Two modes: **Wave** (clear a task count) and **Endurance**
- Difficulty 101 / 201 / 301 → 9 / 6 / 3 drops allowed; also sets atom
  fall speed and spawn rate
- Loss conditions: exceeding the drop limit, or filling the beaker
- Registered version adds ANTI-MATTER and BONUS atom types
- In-game keys: `ESC` abort, `F1` help, `F2` save, `F3` music toggle,
  `F4` sound toggle, `F5` pause
- HUD tracks drops remaining, tasks remaining, and chains made

Strings recovered from the unpacked binary corroborate all of the above and
additionally reference `DEMO.SCR` and a `GAMEBG` resource name.

## Open questions

- `TUBES.RES` directory structure and compression scheme
- Scoring tables, chain multipliers, wave progression curves
- Atom spawn RNG and distribution
- `SETUP.CFG` field layout (65 bytes)
- `TUBES.SAV` layout (960 bytes)
